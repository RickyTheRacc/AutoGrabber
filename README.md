## AutoGrabber
This entire project is made out of spite because my CS teacher refuses to show
us how our projects are actually being tested. Simple program that grabs some
information about the system and autograder files and sends them to a webhook.

## Information Grabbed:
- Java Version
- Java Args
- OS Name
- OS Version
- Grader Files
